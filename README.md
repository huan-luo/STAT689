# Project Name

Least Squares Support Vector Regression in R: Investigating Outlier-Sensitivity in Machine Learning Models 

# Project Report

The project report and codes are integrated into a Jupyter notebook named project.ipynb, which can be found in the file.

## Using the Software

The project codes about LS-SVR, weighted LS-SVR, ridge regression, and weighted ridge regression are written in R. The detailed code development and implementation procedures of LS-SVR, weighted LS-SVR, ridge regression, and weighted ridge regression can be found in project.ipynb.

The example given in the report is a one-dimension predictor dataset. However, the codes developed in this project can also implement the multivariate predictors dataset.
